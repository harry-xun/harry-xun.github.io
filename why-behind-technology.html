            <h3>Construction</h3>

            <p>
                In our exploration of the nature of computers, we began by constructing the simplest possible
                computational systems: an addition circuit and a subtraction circuit.
                In this section, I briefly introduce my adder designs, starting from a single full adder
                and building up to a 2-bit adder.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Full Adder</h4>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/fulladder.png" class="project-image projectshowcase"

                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="mt-3">
                In this full adder, the inputs are X0, Y0, and Carry, and the outputs are Sum and Carryover.
                The Sum represents the result of adding X0 and Y0 together with the Carry as a single bit.
                The Carryover indicates whether this addition produces a carry into the next higher bit:
                a value of 1 means a carry is generated, and 0 means no carry is generated.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">2-bit Adder</h4>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-container">

                    <div class="image-caption">2-bit Adder Block Diagram</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="mt-3">
                By combining one full adder with one half adder, we obtain a simple circuit capable of
                performing 2-bit addition.
                The inputs are X and Y, and the output is Sum = X + Y.
                X is represented as X1X0, Y is represented as Y1Y0,
                and the result is represented as (Sum2)(Sum1)(Sum0).
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Example: X = 01, Y = 10</h4>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-container">

            <p class="mt-3">
                To make the behavior of the circuit clearer, we use X = 01 and Y = 10 as an example.
                In the diagram above, blue highlights indicate the activated components and signal paths.
                As shown, the system correctly outputs the sum 011.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mt-5">2-bit Subtraction</h4>
            <p>
                Next, we look at subtraction. Subtraction is more complex because handling borrows requires the use of
                NOT gates.
                We start with the full subtractor.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3">
                The inputs are X0, Y0, and Borrow In, and the outputs are the Difference Bit and the Borrow Bit.
                The Difference Bit represents the result of subtracting Y0 and Borrow In from X0 as a single bit.
                The Borrow Bit indicates whether this subtraction needs to borrow from the next higher bit:
                1 means a borrow is needed, and 0 means no borrow is needed.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3">
                Similarly, by combining a half subtractor and a full subtractor, we obtain a circuit that can perform
                2-bit subtraction.

            <div class="image-row">

            <p class="mt-3">
                This system performs 2-bit subtraction. The inputs are X and Y, and the output is Dif = X − Y.
                X is represented as X1X0, Y is represented as Y1Y0, and the difference is represented as D1D0.
                When the “−” indicator lights up, it means the result is negative, and the system does not currently
                handle negative values.

            <h3>Deconstruction</h3>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Class Discussion and My Reflection</h4>

            <p>
                During group discussions on the question <em>“Is a broken computer still a computer?”</em>,
                we began to move away from discussing computers as technical artifacts and instead focused
                on the nature and definition of computation itself. As a group, we reached several shared
                assumptions: a computer must be capable of performing computation, and a computer is an object.
                However, we disagreed on what should count as computation and whether computational potential
                alone is sufficient.
            </p>

            <p>
                My position was that a computer is only a computer when it is actively computing.
                When a machine is broken or has no power, it should no longer be considered a computer.
                From this, I developed my own definition: a computer is not a material object, but rather
                a property of an object. When humans or intelligent agents use an object to perform computation,
                that object becomes a computer. In this sense, being a computer describes a state of an object,
                not its physical composition.
            </p>

            <p>
                This view received both agreement and criticism during discussion. One particularly interesting
                counterexample raised by my group was the case of a group of monkeys dividing bananas.
                Does this activity count as computation, and if so, can the monkeys themselves be considered computers?
                Through discussion, we arrived at the idea that when a process is observed and consciously used
                by humans for computation, it can be considered computational. However, this reasoning quickly
                led us back to deeper and unresolved philosophical questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                These included questions such as whether the world is fundamentally material or mental,
                whether humans truly possess consciousness, and whether the human brain is simply a complex
                physical system with no special status. While these questions do not have definitive answers,
                the discussion highlighted that perspective matters deeply when defining what a computer is.
                As a result, I came to see that establishing a unified viewpoint may be both essential and
                extremely difficult when attempting to define computation and computers.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h4 class="mt-5">Pre-class Readings and My Reflection</h4>

        <p>
            The reading that most strongly influenced my thinking was the paper on soldier crabs.
            In this work, the authors construct logic gates by observing how soldier crabs move and make
            decisions when encountering corridors. This was the first example I encountered in which
            computation was implemented using something that is neither a traditional computer nor even
            a conventional tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            This immediately reminded me of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, in which an alien
            civilization treats Earth itself as a massive computer designed to calculate the ultimate
            answer to the universe. If we imagine living in such a world, then Earth and everything on it
            could be considered a computer. Following this line of thought, I began to wonder whether
            computation depends entirely on how an observer interprets the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose there exists an invisible, omnipresent, and omniscient observer who continuously
            observes everything in the world. Under this assumption, the properties of all objects could
            be defined purely by that observer’s intention. If this observer uses everything in the world
            to compute, then according to my definition from the previous section, everything would become
            a computer. Similarly, if the observer attempts to “read” everything, then all objects could
            arguably be called books.
        </p>

        <p>
            This line of reasoning deeply unsettled my conceptual framework. I am uncomfortable grounding
            definitions of the world on an abstract and unobservable third party whose existence and
            intentions cannot be defined or verified. While the soldier crab example expands what can count
            as computation, it also highlights the difficulty of drawing boundaries without appealing to
            an external observer.

        <h4 class="mt-5">Open Questions and Future Directions</h4>

        <p>
            Rather than attempting to resolve broad metaphysical questions about the nature of reality or
            language, I am more interested in narrower and more practical questions. Can a computer exist
            independently of human consciousness? What is the simplest object that can reasonably be called
            a computer?
        </p>

        <p>
            One possible direction is empirical rather than philosophical. If we were to conduct a survey
            presenting different people with a list of objects and asking them whether each should be
            considered a computer, could the results themselves serve as a working definition? While such
            an approach would not resolve philosophical disagreement, it might reveal how people implicitly
            understand computation in practice.

                During Construction Week, we built our own API by calling Gemini’s LLM API together
                with our own designed instruction prompt. My instruction prompt was very simple:

                As shown, the system essentially keeps receiving user input and calling the API.
                The symbol “&gt;” represents user input. At the moment, compatibility between the AI
                system and the CLI system is not perfect. For example, when I type “quit,” the AI
                understands that I want to exit, but the command line only accepts “exit” as the
                termination command.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future, if we want to make the command line interface more intelligent, we
                could integrate actions like ending or restarting conversations into the LLM’s own
                outputs. This would make the system appear more adaptive and smarter.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Based on this, I also built a web system to interact with the AI model.
                Below is a simple homepage view.
            </p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/aiweb1.png" class="project-image projectshowcase" alt="AI assistant web homepage">
                    <div class="image-caption">
                        AI Assistant Web Homepage
                    </div>

                The GenAI assistant on this webpage is built using a lightweight Flask web application.
                The system receives user prompts through URL parameters and sends them to the
                GeminiClient for text generation. The model’s response is then directly displayed
                on the webpage.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of design, I intentionally kept the interface minimal, with only a single
                “/ask” route for interaction. This choice was partly due to time constraints, and
                partly because a minimal structure is sufficient and robust.

            <p class="mt-4">
                A simple interaction example is shown below.
