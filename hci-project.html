        <h3 class="text-center mt-4">Project Overview</h3>
        <p class="text-center text-muted">Laundry at Carleton is tough—finding an available machine, setting a timer, and hoping no one interferes with your load. Once the wash is done, you rush back, hoping for an open dryer, but delays often force us to wait or take wet clothes back to our dorms. A laundry tracking system would benefit both students and staff managing these spaces.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center mt-4">Prototype Description</h3>
        <p class="text-center text-muted">Through interviews with my team members and users, we discovered that users primarily want to know whether there are available machines in their dorm building and how much time remains for their laundry cycle to complete. Based on these user needs, I developed a simple system prototype. The first page serves as the initial interface where users select their dorm building. Once selected, users are directed to the second screen, which presents a clear and visually intuitive display of available machines in their building. When a user clicks on a machine to start a cycle, the interface transitions to the third screen, featuring a prominently displayed timer to keep them informed of the remaining time.</p>
